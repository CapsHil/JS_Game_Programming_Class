<!-- After I have the HTML5 supporting template up, I block out more of 
the HTML.

I've got a place holder for the style, script, and game board, as well 
as placeholders for all of the game pieces. 

It might not stay this way by the end. For example, I might decide to do
the graphics in HTML5 rather than Dynamic HTML, but doing it in this way
helps me think the problem through.

The type attribute on the style and script tags are MIME type specifiers.
There are a lot of MIME types, and sometimes you will need to know the
exact MIME type for a file. This list is handy:

Most of these you will probably never use.

The div (for "division") tag is a general purpose "box" that is used in
HTML to hold things. The "id" attribute is used to uniquely identify
that particular box; no two div tags should have the same id. The class
attribute is used by CSS to style a wide variety of elements with the
same features; multiple HTML tags may use the same class name, and even
may use multiple class names, separated by a space, to combine the
effects of multiples CSS classes.

At this point, there still isn't anything to see, but soon it will take
shape.
